# Custom YouTube-like Video Player

This project aims to recreate the functionality and aesthetics of YouTube's video player using **Bun**, **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**.

‚ö†Ô∏è **This code was created with the purpose of recreating the player and not to make it ready for production. That being said, this code will obviously be subject to evolution to make room for optimization and testing, with the aim of turning it into a package usable by everyone.** ‚ö†Ô∏è
